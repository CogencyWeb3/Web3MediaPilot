## Web3MediaPilot
This project is a coalition of technologists, academics and news and media industry professionals who have come together to research how decentralised technology could be developed and used for news and media. The project will assess how Polkadot et al could be used to benefit the news and media industry by developing trust and new revenue streams. The final outcome of the Web3 for Media Pilot Project is a business plan embedded in a blueprint, intended to lead to a technical build. 

The project starts the week of October 10, 2022, with an estimated ending on the week of December 12, 2022. The project is divided into 3 phases:

- Design Thinking: weeks 1 to 4.
- Solution Validation: weeks 5 to 8.
- Blueprint: weeks 9 and 10.

The project will be run in week-by-week sprints with associated deliverables, which include a weekly update and go/no go for the next sprint. The output of the sprints will form the deliverables for milestones 2a.1 to 2a.8. Sprints will culminate in a blueprint (2b.) outlining what the proposed solution is based on the teamâ€™s research. The blueprint will be stored on github for public access.
