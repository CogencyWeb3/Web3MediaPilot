| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| 1.1 | Intro session & Focus Group  |12.10.2022 - 4PM CET|60min|
| 1.2 | Technology Introduction  |14.10.2022 - 11AM CET|90min|

The first two sessions of the project were devoted to know what are the stakeholders expectations about the project, along with broadening the knowledge of web3 for the future workshops.

## Deliverables (Output)

A focus group (1.1) was held to understand what is the outcome expected at the end of the project. There are 4 areas that participants wish to focus on:

1. Get an understanding about Web3 and how to get buy-in from Senior Management
- Understand the business opportunities and use cases of Web3 in the field of Journalism
- Understand potential monetisation models
- Clear definitions to inform/evangelise our members
- How to develop dynamic communities
- How to do data journalism with blockchain data
- Exposure to how other firms are approaching Web3
- How does governance work
- How to explain to the CEO’s, editors in chief and newsroom all the Web3 benefits

2. How to keep trust from the audience in a decentralised environment
- Is the technology safe and really trustworthy?
- Leverage the existing tech with DAO for fake news detection
- Learning of ways to verifying online content
- Create a censorship-resistant Internet
- How to track provenance of social media content

3. Clear Use Cases that can be applicable in the near future
- How to establish a permanent archive for news content
- Ways to make potential new tools accessible to readers with little tech knowledge
- Develop loyalty and subscriptions through NFT project
- Boundaries for content atomization, ownership, monetization and legal implications in global environment
- Ways to make Login and Registration models accessible
- Figure out where the value lies and what are the opportunities
- Create a media in metaverse
- Connect wallet to the site and CMSs
- Create a marketplace in DeFi for the media

4. Appropriateness of timing to launch Web3 projects
- Understand when this will be mainstream
- Define risks for use of these technologies, including costs and wider scale potential harms
- Is it already worth pursuing?
- Validate if the current technology is mature and cost-effective to support diffusion of blockchain in content management
- What has gone wrong in the past?
- Is it going to create a whole new era for the Media industry?


During the second session (1.2), Radhakrishna Dasari, Technical Education Lead at Web3 Foundation, explained the basics of Web3 and blockchain technology for a diverse audience made up of publishers, engineers and advisors. The topics discussed included but not limited to:

1. Difference between Web3 (an idea of the new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralisation, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics) and Blockchain (technology on which Web3 is based).

2. Blockchain account:
- The user address is effectively the public key, and as the name suggests, is public to all users.
- The user's access to their own account is done through the private key, and as the name suggests must not be disclosed. The fallback plan for a user to enter their account if they lose their private key is the recovery phrase. Recovery phrases and private keys are two halves of the same whole.

3. Proof of Work (PoW) vs. Proof of Stake (PoS):
- Both are consensus mechanisms for achieving agreement on the blockchain network to confirm transactions and produce new blocks to the chain.
- With PoW (e.g. Bitcoin), miners compete against each other to validate transactions and get rewarded. The probability of being selected to build the next block is linked to computation power.
- On the contrary, PoS (e.g. Polkadot) decides on who validates the next block according to how many coins you have at stake, that is, willing to lose if the transaction doesn’t get validated. PoS has widespread support among many industry experts, and decreases the environmental impact.

4. The smart contracts goal is to codify a self-executing set of rules and decision making apparatus of an organisation, eliminating the need for documents and people (middle men) in governing, creating a structure with decentralised control.

5. Polkadot is a sharded blockchain, meaning it connects several chains together in a single network, allowing them to process transactions in parallel and exchange data between chains with security guarantees. Polkadot unites a network of heterogeneous blockchain shards called parachains. These chains connect to and are secured by the Polkadot Relay Chain. They can also connect with external networks via bridges. 



## Next steps

During the second week of the project, Walid Al-Saqaf, Associate Professor in Journalism at Södertörn University in Stockholm, will go through similar projects run in the past: lessons learnt, what worked and what didn’t work and in what could be the suitable directions for the project. Finally, Radhakrishna Dasari will take a deep dive into Blockchain technology and its related applications, strengthening the knowledge of the project participants to start thinking about opportunities for the Media Industry.
