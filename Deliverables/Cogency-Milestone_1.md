# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** In the case of a public [Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program) application, please provide a link to the merged contract (the `.md` file in the [applications](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/applications) directory). In the case of a private application, please provide the name of the project. 
* **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context** (optional)
> Please provide a short paragraph or two connecting the deliverables in this milestone and describing their purpose.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1a. | Bursary Documentation |https://github.com/CogencyWeb3/Web3MediaPilot/blob/main/Deliverables/Cogency-Deliverable_1a.md| We will provide documentation of the process and the fund allocation. The documentation provided for Milestone 1 will demonstrate how to work together on a research project in a decentralised way and can help guide future projects of a similar stakeholder complexity.| 
| 1b.  | Initial Research |https://github.com/CogencyWeb3/Web3MediaPilot/blob/main/Deliverables/Cogency-Deliverable_1b.md| An initial summary of the project plan will be made available.| 

**Additional Information**
This project is a coalition of technologists, academics and news and media industry professionals who have come together to research how decentralised technology could be developed and used for news and media. The project will assess how Polkadot et al could be used to benefit the news and media industry by developing trust and new revenue streams. The final outcome of the Web3 for Media Pilot Project is a business plan embedded in a blueprint, intended to lead to a technical build.
