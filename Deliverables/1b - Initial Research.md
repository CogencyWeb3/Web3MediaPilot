## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

This is a research project where a coalition of technologists, academics and news and media industry professionals are developing a pilot to assess how decentralised technology and Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAO) could be developed for news and media. The final outcome of the Web3 for Media Pilot project is a business plan embedded in a blueprint, intended to lead to a technical build. The project will assess how Polkadot et al could be used to benefit the news and media industry by developing trust and new revenue streams.


### Project Details

The project is a technical and strategic research hybrid that will explore how to create value in a decentralised environment developing a trusted source of content in the metaverse. The highest goal is to create a decentralised proposition that can help sustain a healthy, creative and diverse news and media industry.

There are three hypothesis/approaches to be tested:

1. A decentralised structure can become a value creation vehicle intended to extract new value for the news and media industry from Web3 using the wisdom of groups
2. There is a need to develop a trusted source of content in the metaverse. Our pilot will investigate what a newsstand for metaverses, based on blockchain, could look like
3. We must be product maximalists and not dogmatic Web3 purists: We will test how to use permissioned distributed ledger tech to establish governance that sits between centralised and decentralised philosophies 


### Ecosystem fit

In order to answer the questions above, the project will research on the following key areas:

1. How Web3 technology and structure can be used to help sustain journalism for the next 50 years?
2. What are the technical integration structures that a DAO could adopt with current media infrastructure?
3. How news and other content could be represented in a metaverse in a meritocratic way?
4. To what extent can blockchain technology be used to help re-establish trust in news and the media?
5. What could be the governance for a decentralised structure that allows long-established institutional IP value to sit alongside this new technology?

Based on the inputs of the first 2 workshops, a specific problem will be selected, becoming the target for the solution. The solution will be discussed and assessed during workshops 3 and 4, and validated with industry experts during the rest of the project. The final solution should include some of the following concepts:

1. Strategy for use of CDN for scalability and edge technologies. 
2. Research into integration of CMS with Polkadot and other chains using parachain and research into scalability and rollout strategy across disparate, publishing CMS ecosystem for publishers.	
3. Investigation into using ink! 3.0 from Parity as primary language for smart contract development, assessing native tokens and incorporation of open source projects
4. Strategy for using chain to establish trust through transparency
5. Draft technical diagrams and data flows for end-to-end technical interactions, services and integrations that may form an MVP
6. Proposals for launching a new product, if that fits with the conclusion of the research
7. Draft governance for a future entity, such as a DAO. 
8. Exploration of reporting and monitoring tools
9. Research of hosting environments including AWS for suitable, performant ecosystem
10. dApp scoping for content creation, sharing and trust models in decentralised form focusing on privacy and security.
