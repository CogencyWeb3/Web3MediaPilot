## Output

After all the discussions we had in the first 4 weeks of the project, the project team has narrowed the focus of the project to the following 7 main areas, in which the Media industry can take advantage of Web3:

- Registration, paywalls, micropayments	
- Content collaboration and commissioning chains	
- Advertising Accountability platform	
- Metadata opportunities	
- New production frameworks	
- High-risk journalism fund	
- Social media platform

We gathered the group interests in the previous 7 areas by using a [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiQ-AGPLjfRPfm9m-CEWRO6-CfZ_CrQv-5E0VrJQW1xEHIng/viewform) and a session with all the stakeholders. Each of the 7 areas were ranked from 1 to 6 based on 5 different criteria:

- Audience Impact
- Business Impact
- Net Value for business and/or audience, which is subtracting costs
- Ease to Market
- Long-term business strategy/scalability

With the results below:

The following insights can be extracted front the results above:

- Looking just at the average, Registration, paywalls and micropayments area is the overall winner: with an average of 4.86 across all criteria.
- But Metadata Opportunities is really close, 4.70 winning in 3 out of 5 criterias. Registration won in just 2. 
- For the reason above, we canâ€™t conclude there is only one winner but two: 
  - Registration, paywalls and micropayments
  - Metadata opportunities
 - The rest of the areas are far away from the winners

We have also depicted the table above using a spider diagram. Each colour is an area, with 5 apexes for each criteria. The two winner areas, yellow and blue, stand out from the rest.

## Next steps
During the next sprint, the group will work on outlining a specific solution within the winner areas.
