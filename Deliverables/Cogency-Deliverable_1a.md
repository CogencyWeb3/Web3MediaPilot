## Deliverable Number

## Context

Author: Stephen Fozard, Project Director, Global Alliance for Media Innovation (GAMI) at WAN-IFRA.

## Context 
Cogency aims to research and try to understand the implications of Web3 for publishers in the future. It is therefore crucial to involve content producers and publishers as soon as possible in the process. 
However, many media organisations don’t have enough time and resources to put towards research and development work, not to mention that Web3 and its potential implications might not even be high on their agendas.

At the writing phase of the project, WAN-IFRA suggested to devote a small part of the budget to two or three bursaries reserved for WAN-IFRA members to apply for. The bursaries aim to compensate members for the time they will commit to the project - which should be a minimum of half a day per week over 10 weeks but also as an incentive to join the Cogency project.

It was decided that the bursaries needed to be accessible through an easy and low admin application process, to not add to the burden and create more problems that they were meant to solve.

The measurable success of this milestone would be the successful allocation of the bursaries on time and on budget.

## Application process
We announced the bursary opportunity at the end of the month of August through a Press Release sent out by WAN-IFRA CEO Vincent Peyrègne to the whole WAN-IFRA database. 
It was an easy application process through the following online [application form](https://form.typeform.com/to/Y8M5BL3r)

The deadline to apply was 11 September midnight and we set up an application through the following 

- Applicants were asked to answer the following questions:
- Please provide the name of your organisation or company.      
- Please provide a short description of your organisation or company.       
- Please provide a link to your organization or company's website, or any other relevant online information.     
- Are you a member of WAN-IFRA ? If not, would you be interested to discuss ?
- Please share your interest in decentralized technologies  
- Example: Past, current or future projects, corporate strategic positioning or simple curiosity etc.
- How will the bursary help your business explore Web3 technology ?   Please note the bursaries range between €1,500 and €4,000
- How much and what type of resources can you commit to the Web3 Pilot over the period October to December 2022 ? (Ideally minimum 0,5 days per week) Example: technical, commercial, strategy, editorial or other.

By the deadline, we had received 16 applications eligible to be assessed.

## Criteria for selection and Jury deliberation

The Jury consisted of:
- David Tomchak, Cogency Coordinator

On 12 September, the Jury had a meeting to study all applications against the following criteria:

1. WAN-IFRA member (eliminatory)
2. TYPE OF ORGANISATION	
3. LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT IN WEB3 TECHNOLOGIES	
4. USE OF THE GRANT	
5. NECESSITY OF THE GRANT

The best 3 candidates were: Mediahuis, Publico and le groupe Parisien - Les Echos.

## Bursary collection

It was agreed the bursary collection for each winner would be done at the end of the project. Winners will raise a purchase order with Cogency. 

## Communication

The bursary applicants and winners were told of their status the day after the selection process took place. A formal announcement was prepared to coincide with a relevant event, in this case Web Summit. Web3 Foundation, WAN-IFRA and Cogency all created comms to support the allocation of the bursaries.

## Conclusion

The bursary allocation process was a success. It was done on time and on budget.
