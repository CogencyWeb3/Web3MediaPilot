# W3F Grant Proposal
- **Project Name:** Cogency
- **Team Name:** Cogency

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

This project is a coalition of technologists, academics and news and media industry professionals who have come together to research how decentralised technology could be developed and used for news and media. The project will assess how Polkadot et al could be used to benefit the news and media industry by developing trust and new revenue streams. The final outcome of the Web3 for Media Pilot Project is a business plan embedded in a blueprint, intended to lead to a technical build. 


### Project Details

The project is a technical and strategic research hybrid that explores how to create value in a decentralised environment, developing a trusted source of content. The highest goal is to create a decentralised proposition that can help sustain a healthy, creative and diverse news and media industry.

There are three hypothesis/approaches to be tested:

1. A decentralised structure can become a value creation vehicle intended to extract new value for the news and media industry from Web3 technology.
2. There is a need to develop a trusted source of content in emergent Web3 environments. Our pilot will include a debate on what a newsstand for metaverses, based on blockchain, could look like for example.
3. We must be product maximalists and not dogmatic Web3 purists: We will test how to use permissioned distributed ledger tech to establish governance that sits between centralised and decentralised philosophies. How do media institutions fit into a decentralised environment, for example.


### Ecosystem fit

In order to answer the questions above, the project will research on the following key areas:

1. How Web3 technology and structure can be used to help sustain journalism for the next 50 years?
2. What are the technical integration structures that decentralised technologies could adopt to fit with current media infrastructure?
3. How can news and other content be represented in a decentralised or meta environment in a meritocratic way?
4. To what extent can blockchain technology be used to help re-establish trust in news and the media?
5. What could be the governance for a decentralised structure that allows long-established institutional IP value to sit alongside this new technology?

Based on the inputs of the first 2 workshops, a specific problem will be selected, becoming the target for the solution. The solution will be discussed and assessed during workshops 3 and 4, and validated with industry experts during the rest of the project. The research should include some of the following concepts:

1. Strategy for use of CDN for scalability and edge technologies. 
2. Research into integration of CMS with Polkadot and other chains using parachain and research into scalability and rollout strategy across disparate, publishing CMS ecosystem for publishers.
3. Investigation into using ink! 3.0 from Parity as primary language for smart contract development, assessing native tokens and incorporation of open source projects.
4. Strategy for using chain to establish trust through transparency.
5. Draft technical diagrams and data flows for end-to-end technical interactions, services and integrations that may form an MVP.
6. Proposals for launching a new product, if that fits with the conclusion of the research.
7. Draft governance for a future entity, such as a DAO.  
8. Exploration of reporting and monitoring tools.
9. Research of hosting environments including AWS for suitable, performant ecosystem.
10. dApp scoping for content creation, sharing and trust models in decentralised form focusing on privacy and security.

### Timeline

**Phase 1: Design Thinking**

This phase will last 4 weeks, and is meant to develop a common understanding of the opportunity through panel discussions for iteration and discovery of the problem we are trying to solve. Once the problem is clearly identified, there will be further discussions about possible solutions, and finally a proposed solution will be selected based on KPIs (e.g. time, complexity, profitability, etc.).

This phase also serves as key concept sharing and agreeing direction of  tech products for the solution validation phase of the project based on research, workshops, interviews and analysis.

- Week 1: Sprint & Technology Introduction
  - Goal: Develop a common understanding (DeFi, DAO, NFT, Parachains, Wallets, etc.) and get to know one another. Discuss the technology including interoperability, attribution of ownership, PoW vs. PoS, smart contracts, etc.
  - Activities: Interviews, web3 Foundation technology workshop.

- Week 2: Defining the Problem
  - Goal: Opportunity analysis and definition of the problem we are trying to solve.
  - Activities: Guided blue sky workshops on Trust, Governance and Commercial opportunities. Follow up Interviews. Case studies.

- Week 3: Defining the Opportunity (1/2)
  - Goal: Follow on from Week 2, review the variety of options to solve the problem. Continue analysis of opportunities. 
  - Activities: Brainstorming workshop based on the output of Week 2.

- Week 4: Defining the Opportunity (2/2)
  - Goal: Follow up from the previous week, where the analysis will be completed.
  - Activities: Interviews, workshop, go/ no go for Phase 2 (see below). 
  - Risk: An idea isn’t suitable enough to move the project forward.
  - Mitigation plan: Re-run Week 3 and Week 4 together to agree on a proposed solution. 


**Phase 2: Solution Validation**

This phase will last 4 weeks and is meant to validate the proposed solution, drilling down into the detail of impact, risks and opportunities. There will be a refinement of the proposed solution, and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative research from the stakeholders. Finally, expert insights will be gathered in the form of diagrams, flows and charts.

This phase will also develop a detailed technical product blueprint and draft business proposal for future rollout of a product. From this point, subgroups will be created based on the project needs. 

- Week 5: Solution Selection 
  - Goal: Define the criteria for the radar chart for solution selection. Select the solution based on the radar chart, and get an assessment on current progress from Web3 Foundation.
  - Activities: Interviews, workshops.

- Week 6: Solution Assessment
  - Goal: Assess the suitability of the proposed solution: does it really address the problem in a way that makes sense? Is it scalable? Other considerations? 
  - Activities: Interviews, workshops.

- Week 7: Expert feedback and Solution Refinement
  - Goal: Further insights gathering from experts to outline the proposed solution. Risk assessment and solution feasibility in the market. Continuation of the previous session to refine the solution.
  - Activities: Interviews, workshops.

- Week 8: Present Solution with a draft blueprint
  - Goal: A draft blueprint should be presented, and the last round of feedback will be gathered. 
  - Activities: Interviews, workshops.


**Phase 3: Blueprint**

The last two weeks of the project (Week 9 and 10)  will be dedicated to refine the Blueprint which will include a Business Plan, and they will be also used to gather extra feedback from stakeholders and schedule any extra workshop needed.


## Future Plans  :sparkler: 
The main outcome of the research portion of the pilot is to provide learning and a space to share knowledge between media and Web3 industries. However, the blueprint will include a roadmap for technical build and a plan for securing investment for any product suggestions. Based on this, the hope is to finance, build and launch a new product in H1 of 2023. This would be a new phase - version 2 - of the project. Longer term we hope version 2 is a success in helping develop trust and increase revenue for the media and news industries in a way that is sustainable and equitable.
