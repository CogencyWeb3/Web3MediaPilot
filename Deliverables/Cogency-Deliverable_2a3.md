| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| 3.1 | Brainstorming (1/2)  |25.10.2022 - 3.30PM CET|90min|
| 3.2 | Brainstorming (2/2) |28.10.2022 - 3PM CET|90min|

This week the group has focused on understanding how Blockchain can help in the five main Media Areas below:

- Sharing and Distribution
- Monetisation
- Verification
- Archiving
- Production

taking into account six different Angles:

- Users
- Needs & Opportunities
- Mechanisms
- Technologies
- Challenges
- Products & Results
 
Walid Al-Saqaf, Associate Professor in Journalism at Södertörn University in Stockholm, and David Tomchack have run 4 brainstorming sessions across Sprints 3 and 4 to relate 5 Media Areas with the 6 Angles depicted above.

## Output

To get a sense of the group’s interests, a survey has been carried out among the six main Media Areas, which has determined the order to follow:

### Sharing & Distribution      

#### Users:      
- Content creators, included but not limited to: [writing NFTs](https://dev.mirror.xyz/5gt60vKFJZ_tR1BjoJ7-Y0sNw7REebStHjzFU5x73J0), web browser producers, [social media posts](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/opinion/social-data-google-facebook-europe.html)
- Content consumers, including end users and influencers to boost the [network effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-effect.asp).
- News & Government Agencies
- Corporations
- Media organisations
- [Direct & Indirect audiences](https://feelgoodretail.com/2021/03/18/the-audience-ecosystem-direct-and-indirect-audiences/)
- Social platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Youtube & Google. Each of them with their own policies and strategies.
     
#### Needs & Opportunities:      
- Instead of paid subscriptions on a web2 newsletter platform, such as Substack, Web3 enables content creators and community builders to manage their audience through memberships using either NFTs or ERC-20 tokens.
- IP rights (provenance)
- Expanding audience reach
- Controlling the revenue earned from the content you produce (with immutability and traceability and provenance factors) via royalties or other means in ever changing hands
- Crediting  the publisher and tracking the IP: for a  publisher, an opportunity could be [neighbour rights](https://www.anarapublishing.com/what-are-neighbouring-rights/), e.g. being paid by GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon) when they are using the publisher content
- Building standards to engage and attract an audience (mostly younger generations). 
- Building community & interactive 
- On-chain sharing or engagement with NFT purchases creates a signal which can be used for audience development, advertising, etc.

#### Mechanisms:      
- Across platforms. How? Ubiquity & Immutability  
- Avoid middlemen, e.g. for the content consumers, would it be something like a marketplace? In other words, if you get a great photo of a natural disaster you can post it on the platform and media companies can use it without bombarding you with messages.
- Secondary market with more variety of products to increase the portfolio (less volume): [long tail vs. short tail](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-tail.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20the%20Long%20Tail,reduced%20number%20of%20popular%20items.).
- Trigger to original content
- Web3 to increase the number of data to train models for Machine Learning

#### Technologies:      
- Web3 (still aspirational) to connect with any compatible systems (browsers?).
- DAO
- NFT to guarantee provenance and traceability. NFT has a membership proof to have the right to share and distribute
- Custom/dedicated blockchain, taking into account the overhead, isolation and security challenges
- [Permissioned](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/permissioned-blockchains.asp#:~:text=A%20permissioned%20blockchain%20is%20a,certificates%20or%20other%20digital%20means.) (=non public, less equality) vs. Public (more democratic)  blockchains 
- We need a dedicated parachain covering all the use cases that we identified, a web3 standard for exchanging content and monetization, and a browser plugin

#### Challenges:      
- Lack of compatibility: our solution should be simple enough to be used across any language/blockchain (with the needed adjustments)
- As consumers are not ready yet, tech should be invisible and super easy to use.
- Factoring the competition in: Polkadot vs. Cosmos, etc.
- Democratising journalism can harm the newsroom: How do we filter? Trust? 
- Uncertainty. Blockchains continue to evolve. At the moment, it is not known which one will be suitable for journalism or content creation, but it is most likely that there will be several, and whatever they are, must be interoperable. So far, [thanks to DAOS and NFTs, we have seen a high degree of engagement](https://www.prweb.com/releases/web3_company_trustless_media_raises_3_25_million_seed_round_led_by_ftx_ceo_sam_bankman_fried_and_others_to_create_community_owned_shows/prweb18805239.htm).  
- Compatibility. The current state of the art must be compatible with the proposed solution.

#### Products & Results:      
- Improved registration and paywalls to tailor the user experience. Web3 can bring one set of content/services tailored to each user, and a membership rather than a subscription. Subscribers can discuss between them and with journalists on next features, services and topics to include in the subscription offer.
- Web3 powered newsletters: 
  - [Joining Web2 & Web3](https://paragraph.xyz/)
  - [Dirt](https://dirt.fyi/), a web3 native publication run in Ethereum
- [pubDAO](https://pubdao.co/): A media DAO seeking to redefine media production and distribution using web3 tools. 

### Monetisation     

#### Users:      
- Most of the previous users still apply. For monetisation, special emphasis on:
  - Large Advertisers both agencies & corporations/brands 
  - Small Advertisers - Local news, which have a twofold role: creating and sharing.
  - Collectors, creating network effects to unfold new sources of revenue
     
#### Needs & Opportunities:      
- Package data/content by removing major blockers to deliver the article. Pre rendered content to areas with low Internet connectivity.
- Prevention of abuse of central platforms. This will allow win-win situations for both platforms & users.
- Speed increase from a process point of view (eliminating the middlemen) rather than from the connectivity per se.
- Micropayments

#### Mechanisms:      
- Pay to play / Pay to read. This model hasn’t worked yet because the user is not incentivized enough and it’s difficult to implement. It has two dimensions:
  - Decentralised payments. The company pays the content creator in a decentralised way (crypto) to avoid capital control issues (e.g. Ukraine war).
  - Loyalty points earned by reading content to engage end users to increase trust. It’s not just about the points, but to understand the user needs based on the metadata you are getting from them. This will allow us to tailor the content we offer. 
- Gamification. Based on current experience, possibly is not the best course of action. 
- Data:
  - Users need to have control over their own data. The most important data is the one the user volunteers to share. 
  - Business models based on wrong variables due to  information overflow. More isn’t better: we need to understand the key variables that drive customer expenditure.
  - Contextual and behavioural data (e.g. if a user has shared an article or not, if the article has been read or not)  is more useful than demographic data (e.g. gender, age, location).
- Time difference between publishing time and when the article gets most of the traffic. We should ensure the content creator is being paid during this time.

#### Technologies:      
- Blockchain tokens
- Seamless, invisible and transparent.
- Simple. We need to avoid the 40+ steps to buy a token from Civil (lessons learned) 
- Easy to integrate with CMSs, with  risk of adding a certain degree of (needed) centralisation. The CMS should be only used for content creation and the result injected in the chain
- Open source

#### Challenges:      
- Taxation and legal jurisdiction are not there yet. Unknowns about what can be done without getting into trouble.
- Token volatility as the means to run processes. 

#### Products & Results:      
- Incentivizing participation. Products like [Google Bulletin](https://www.failory.com/google/bulletin#:~:text=Description,quality%20websites%20for%20small%20businesses.) or  Nextdoor are interesting when you think about rewarding higher quality information sharing and curation.
- [Friends with Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/) - [V.I.P. lounge for crypto’s creative class](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/technology/friends-with-benefits-crypto-dao.html?unlocked_article_code=zdCUKFJU9JyB-Ei2aPkllPk0DtEWrLOHpRI3UYbYWl79_FOSFCr-N1GddrTyeZu1nOICfntaOlAcu2Dx12lRN0vG3I8iOV5-VoxgmxYyI8d8m8m8_4o92CUpQgvWlb9vkmLLY-OvQ6FqSMeYiLXqvtjatHy5c89AxAym6HsFR3PyrcwcQ6_v2fRLA6EJQTGSQ66Q1azhenYmvgW32T80bDcayPLF8KkeOi2v-Av9oYwOwNKVWg81JC0cB0l5M2rOdpsqBpmwDe2Hga00pEb-ycsx2pkJCO7T96glhfGaX7pnTMiPaXfGwkrHY9lz5RShbzEQmm9f-REXQy2tblzn2fQV42W_omQAq_5u8MI&smid=share-url)
- We have a decentralised network with nodes across the world, can we monetise some sort of knowledge transfer? Web2 can cover this, but currently with middlemen.
- A couple of examples:
  - Human resources with some spare time. 
  - A photojournalist can then be shared from company X to company Y in an easier way.
